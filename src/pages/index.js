          <Content>
            Tarot is many things to many people, but in the simplest terms, itâ€™s a deck of 78 cards. Each card has its own imagery and meaning. For hundreds of years, people have used these cards for divination.

          <Content>
            <p>We offer two kinds of readings: the three-card spread and the eleven-card spread.</p>

            <p>Three-card spread readings last typically 15-20 minutes. The cards represent either Past, Present, and Future or Mind, Body, and Spirit. Your choice. Suggested donation is $15.</p>

            <p>The eleven-card spread is our variation on the Celtic Cross. These full, thorough readings give you insight into the core of a situation, including information about your past, present, future, highest self, environment, hopes and fears, and outcome. They typically last around 45 minutes, and suggested donation is $30.</p>
